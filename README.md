# Speculative Play 2022

## Sharon Ku

Welcome to my Speculative Play Summer 2022 Project! 🎆 _cue fireworks_ 🎆

What are you looking for?

- Documentation? --> https://github.com/sharon-ku/spec-play2022/wiki
- The actual game? --> https://sharon-ku.github.io/spec-play2022/
  - note that the game is just a seedling at the moment 🌱, but you'll get to see it blossom real soon 🌼 (patience, my friend)

In this game, I want to explore a world where communications are dominated by emojis and emojis _only_. They are the universal language and people must pay to access more "words" to speak with.
